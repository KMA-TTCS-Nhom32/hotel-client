      "para1": "Established in 1926 with the most prime location in Hanoi capital, near cultural, commercial, and financial centers, A HomeVilla is one of the unique architectural works that mark the mark of the French. . Over 100 years of establishment and development, A HomeVilla has been honored to welcome many diplomatic delegations, senior leaders and domestic and international businessmen.",
      "para2": "A HomeVilla started as a beer bar called Le Coq d'Or (Brasserie Le Coq d'Or) located at the corner of Carreau Avenue and Henri-Rivière (Ly Thuong Kiet and Ngo Quyen streets today). Around the beginning of the 20th century (1917 - 1918), the French decided to build a 2-storey hotel here, featuring French architecture with the name Le Coq d'Or (Golden Rooster) with 56 rooms, including 12 luxury rooms.",
      "para3": "On May 19, 1931, after the owner transfer process, Le Coq d'Or Hotel was renovated and upgraded. The hotel lobby was expanded, the number of floors was also increased to 3 floors, with a total of 80 rooms. At this time, the hotel was renamed Splendid (Cho Bong Lai), officially opened on January 1, 1932.",
      "para4": "In 2016, with a comprehensive renovation project by the professional hotel management and consulting unit STS, Hoa Binh Hotel had a completely new look. What is worth noting, and what every tourist and resident looks forward to, is that the hotel's architectural imprints from the French period are still preserved intact.",
